# Backdrops

## town / anchorhead / rooftops

From this distance, all you can make out of Anchorhead are the leaning shapes of its rooftops,
huddled in a thin, jagged line against the base of the hills to the south.

## sea

The great, gray ocean stretches out as far as you can see, merging with the clouds on the horizon.

## heath / grass

The undulating heath stretches away to the west and northwest, an unending carpet of colorless
grass.

# ash

They're just ordinary-looking drifting flakes of ash.

# mill

The dark structure of the paper mill squats broodingly in the crook of the Miskaton river.
