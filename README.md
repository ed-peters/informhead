[ TODO - effect in Mill & Shanty Town - Flakes of ash drift gently down from the sky like gray snow, coating everything with a thin layer of soot, which is quickly washed away by the rain. ]

[ TODO - effect in ??? - In the distance, you can hear the lonesome keening of a train whistle drifting on the wind. You look to the east in time to see the train go by, rolling southwest past the mill toward less melancholy climes.]

[ TODO - when entering shanty town ??? - A pair of starving dogs come sniffing around the refuse by one of the shacks, but as soon as you move they shy away, disappearing over the edge of the clearing. ]

[ TODO - Beyond the breakwater's tip, a turbulent patch of water bubbles and seethes, as if something were lurking just beneath the surface -- turning, perhaps, in uneasy sleep. ]

[ A cold, noiseless draft coils through the narrow entrance hall. You shiver, wondering where it came
from. ]
